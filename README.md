# How ot use
## Scan model

![](img/extension_tab.jpg)  

Click it, extension will scan all your models to generate SHA256 hash, and use this hash, to get model information and preview images from civitai.  

For each model, it will create a json file to save all model info from civitai. This model info file will be "Your_model_name.civitai.info" in your model folder.

If a model info file is already exists, it will skip this model. If a model can not be find in civitai, it will create an empty model info file, so it won't scan this model twice. 

### Add new models 
When you have some new models, just click this button again, to get new model's information and preview images.  

## Model Card
Open SD webui's build-in "Extra Network" tab, to show model cards.
