# Install

Copy this project's url into it, click install.

Alternatively, download this project as a zip file, and unzip it to `Your SD webui folder/extensions`.

Then reload UI with "Reload UI" Button in Setting tab.

Done.

# How to Use
## Scanning Models
Go to extension tab "Civitai Helper". There is a button called "Scan model".

![](img/extension_tab.jpg)

Click it and the extension will scan all your models to generate SHA256 hashes, using them to retreive model information and preview images from Civitai.

For each model, it will create a json file to save all model info from Civitai. This model info file will be "Your_model_name.civitai.info" in your model folder.

If a model info file already exists, it will be skipped. If a model cannot be found in Civitai, it will create an empty model info file, so the model won't be scanned twice.

### Adding New Models
When you have some new models, just click this button again, to get new model's information and preview images.

## Model Card
**(Use this only after you scanned your models!)**
Open SD webui's build-in "Extra Network" tab, to show model cards.

Move your mouse on to the bottom of a model card. It will show 4 icon buttons:
  - üñº: Modified "replace preview" text into this icon
  - üåê: Open this model's Civitai url in a new tab
  - üí°: Add this model's trigger words to prompt
  - üè∑: Use this model's preview image's prompt

If you click the Refresh Button of extra network, those additional buttons will be removed. You can click the `Refresh Civitai Helper` button to bring them back.
