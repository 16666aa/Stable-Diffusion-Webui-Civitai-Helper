# Stable-Diffusion-Webui-Civitai-Helper
Stable Diffusion Webui Extension for Civitai, to handle your models much more easily.

## Notice
From today(2023-02-10), Civitai is redirecting its API request to Cloudflare's real human checking page. Which makes this extension can not get any information back from civitai.  

If you have this issue. You have to wait for civitai to update its API usage. If you don't have this issue, you are luckier than me.  

## About Version
Latest version is powerful but experimental. If you have issue, you can go back to 1.2.1 by download old version from Civitai: [Civitai Url](https://civitai.com/models/16768/civitai-helper-sd-webui-civitai-extension)  

# Features
* Scans all models to download model information and preview images from Civitai.  
* Modified Built-in "Extra Network" cards, to add the following buttons on each card:
  - üñº: Modified "replace preview" text into this icon
  - üåê: Open this model's Civitai url in a new tab
  - üí°: Add this model's trigger words to prompt
  - üè∑: Use this model's preview image's prompt

# Install
Go to SD webui's extension tab, go to `Install from url` sub-tab.
Copy this project's url into it, click install.

Alternatively, download this project as a zip file, and unzip it to `Your SD webui folder/extensions`.

Then reload UI with "Reload UI" Button in Setting tab.

Done.

# How to Use
## Update Your SD Webui
This extension need to get extra network's cards id. **Which is added to SD webui since 2023-02-06.** 

So, if you are using a version earlier than this, you need to update your SD Webui! 

## Scanning Models
Go to extension tab "Civitai Helper". There is a button called "Scan model".  

![](img/extension_tab.jpg)

Click it and the extension will scan all your models to generate SHA256 hashes, using them to retreive model information and preview images from Civitai.

**Scanning takes time, just wait it finish**

For each model, it will create a json file to save all model info from Civitai. This model info file will be "Your_model_name.civitai.info" in your model folder.

If a model info file already exists, it will be skipped. If a model cannot be found in Civitai, it will create an empty model info file, so the model won't be scanned twice.

### Adding New Models
When you have some new models, just click scan button again, to get new model's information and preview images. It won't scan the same model twice. 

## Model Card
**(Use this only after you scanned your models!)** 
Open SD webui's build-in "Extra Network" tab, to show model cards.

![](img/extra_network.jpg)


Move your mouse on to the bottom of a model card. It will show 4 icon buttons:
  - üñº: Modified "replace preview" text into this icon
  - üåê: Open this model's Civitai url in a new tab
  - üí°: Add this model's trigger words to prompt
  - üè∑: Use this model's preview image's prompt

![](img/model_card.jpg)

If these additional buttons are not there, click the `Refresh Civitai Helper` button to bring them back.  

![](img/refresh_ch.jpg)  
Everytime after Extra Network tab refreshed, it will remove all these additional buttons. So, you need to click `Refresh Civitai Helper` button to bring them back.  

## Preview Image
Extra network uses both `model_file.png` and `model_file.preview.png` as preview image. But `model_file.png` has higher priority, because it is created by yourself.  

When you don't have the higher priority one, it will use the other automatically.  

## Prompt
When you click the button "Use prompt from preview image", it does not use the prompt from your own preview image. It uses the one from civitai's  preview image.  

On civitai, a model's preview images may not has prompt. This extension will check this model's all civitai preview images' information and use the first one has prompt in it.  

## SHA256
To create a file SHA256, it need to read the whole file to generate a hash code. It gonna be slow for big files. 

Default, it uses a Memory Optimized SHA256 which won't stuck your system. So, do not uncheck it if you want to use your computer when scanning.  

There are 2 cases this hash code can not find the model on civitai:
* Some old models, which do not have SHA256 code on civitai.
* The model's owner changed file on civitai, but does not change version number and description. So, the file on civitai is actually not the one on your manchine.  

In these cases, you can always link a model to civitai by filling its URL in this extension from v1.3.


Enjoy!
